Today it was different
The memories were flowing thick and fast
Some of them good some of them bad
But mostly unchecked and unmarked
The night was silent, and dark was deeper
Though some sounds intercepting some parts.

Maybe I could have done better
To avoid the slowly creeping echoes of past
But I guess I was tricked again by dreaded sleepless night
That I believed there was soothing in those thoughts at last



I still remember that septemeber
It was a decade and half back at best
I was sitting and laughing with my grandma
She was also laughing, gray locks across her face
I was ten, young and inncoent
She was old and innocent in seventies I guess.

I often wish that she was still around
To see the man I am now, earning breads
She moved on as it was bound to happen
But our home is definetely somewhat less


The train of thoughts have moved forward
To the day I had to say goodbye
To my mom, to my dad, to my grandma
And to the village I thought was my home till I'll die
I was definetely sad but mom was inconsolable
Though she tried to act strong, but it was all in her eyes.

Everyone called it the next phase of my life
But my heart desparately wanted old times, I won't lie
Guess, I have gotten used to it after all these years
But on that day I just cried, cried and cried


And now I can't help but think of
About the girl, I still dream with joy mostly
She was lovely, innocent and graceful
And her heart seemed to resemble mine closely
I believed she was there to stay forever
But after a moment she said goodbye slowly.

Maybe the days were wrong, maybe my nights were sad
Or maybe I just couldn't bear being lonely
I often wonder what I could have done differently
But then again she was never meant to stay probably


I believe some part of me has always told me
To move forward, away from the snares of these nights
'You can never have something forever' it always said
'Regrets will always be there if you look back, alright'
'The pleasures and pain of past memories are an illusion'
'And the life is beyond it and you have to make it right.'

To be honest, I know deep down it has a claim
For these memories always speak what I wished in quiet.
I wish that the waves of time will do us apart soon
But till then, I know I'll seek comfort in them another night.
